# freeCodeCamp_DB_certification


These are the projects required to obtain the database certification on freecodecamp.org, and some other exercises of the certification that I deemed interesting enough to save.

The scripts need permission to execute : `$ chmod +x <script_name>`


## Files and folders


- universe.sql is a postgreSQL database built from scratch. It is one of the required learning projects for the certification.

- five_shell_programs is a collection of 5 shell scripts.

- student_database_part_1 is a postgreSQL database with a shell script to populate it from 2 csv files. 

- student_database_part_2 is a script with more complex queries on the 'student.sql' database.
