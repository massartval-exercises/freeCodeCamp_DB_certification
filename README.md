# freeCodeCamp_DB_certification


These are the projects required to obtain the database certification on freecodecamp.org, and some other exercises of the certification that I deemed interesting enough to save.

The scripts need permission to execute :

`$ chmod +x <script_name>`

- universe.sql is a postgreSQL database.

- five_shell_programs is a collection of 5 scripts.

- student_database_part_1 is a postgreSQL database with a bash script to populate it from 2 csv files.
